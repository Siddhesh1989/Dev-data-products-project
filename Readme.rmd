This is a readme document for the developing data products week 3 project
I have created a simple project that deals with linear regression.
Using the mtcars data set, the user can see the effects of fitting a linear regressor between mileage(miles per gallon) on the y axis and weight of the car (on a scale of hundreds of pounds) on the x axis
The user inputs his guess at the best fit line's slope and intercept via 2 slider inputs
On hitting the submit button, a blue line is drawn on the plot to show the regression line drawn as per the user's specifications
The red line shows the best fit regression line
The sum of residuals (absolute values only) is also shown on the plot, based on the user inputted regression lines
